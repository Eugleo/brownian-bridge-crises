# Exploring Text Coherence in International Relations Data

_Authors:_ Ali Gorji, Alexis Perakis, Ev≈æen Wybitul

This project aimed to explore whether it would be possible to tweak existing methods that are used for text-coherence to analyze some notion of coherence in international crises (from the ICBe dataset). While we were ultimately unable to answer this question in the affirmative, we have shed some light on the inner workings of the method itself, as well as sketched out a few avenues for future research.

Below you can see an illustration of how well we captured coherence in the crises; for full details, please see the [report](report.pdf).
